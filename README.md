# DEVTOP SCRIPTS
Archive of usefull and semi-usefull scripts.
Neatly packaged in one repository.

### Navigation
To find the script your looking for, ask yourself three questions:

1. Which OS do I run?

2. Which program/category do I need?

3. What does my script need to do?

And after that, download the script you need.

### Contribution
Every contribution is welcome. Just file an issue or pull request.
Even if it's semi-usefull I will take it. I will support every OS and application there is.
So even scripts that use **Dtrace** and run on **Illumos** will be supported.

However, when it comes to scripting languages there are some limitations.
Only scripting languages from **standard shells** are supported.
For example: On Windows only Batch and Powershell are supported.
On Linux/UNIX all POSIX compliant shells are supported.

### License
All scripts can have there own licenses, as long as there opensource!

### Systems
- [X] Linux
- [ ] BSD (UNIX)
- [ ] Darwin
